# HackCWRU-2020

Unimote is a server-and-client system that we created during participating in HackCWRU 2020. Our vision is to help teachers support their students through remotely controling students' computers.

Shoutout to my members for their great work:
* Minh Pham and Hieu Nguyen - UI/ UX coding & design
* Viet Dinh - Client (version for students)
* Trung Nguyen (me) - Server (version for teachers)
